## Background

We are thrilled to present to you a groundbreaking innovation in interplanetary finance: KaseiCoin. Our journey to Mars represents not just a leap for mankind but also a giant stride for financial systems. As we establish the first human colony on the Red Planet, we bring forth KaseiCoin – a currency designed to thrive in the Martian economy.

KaseiCoin, deriving its name from the Japanese word for Mars, is a testament to our global collaboration. It is a fungible token, fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, ensuring seamless integration with the existing blockchain infrastructure.

We are initiating a crowdsale, a unique opportunity for future Martians to be part of this historic venture by converting their Earth currencies into KaseiCoin. This isn’t just a new cryptocurrency; it’s the dawn of a new era for commerce across planets. Join us as we make history.

## Requirements
* Solidity ~ version ^0.5.0
* Remix IDE
* MetaMask
* Ganache
* OpenZepplin

## Smart Contracts
Using the Remix IDE and Solidity we wrote 3 smart contracts to create and run not only the KaseiCoin Token but also the Crowdsale to fund the new venture


- ### KaseiCoin Token Creation Smart Contract

## Evidence 
Here I have included screenshots and short video clips to guide you throught the entire process.
### Step 1: Getting accounts setupo and deploying the Crowdsale contract
- Connecting Ganache with MetaMask.

- Then getting MetaMask connected to Remix IDE.

### Step 2: Open Crowdsale Contract 
- Open the Crowdsale contract to make a purchase

Thank you to everyone for showing your support and we can see you are just as thrilled as us. The goal of raising the the amount we needed was reached in a short amount of time. We could hardly believe it, The finalized contract end date is still weeks away but, again thanks to you we smashed the odds. Ladies and Gentlemen, buck up... We are headed not only to Mars but The future... The Future of finance.
